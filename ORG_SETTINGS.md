# ORG_SETTINGS.md

**Intended state of GitHub settings for Nyuchi Web Services.**

Most of what's in this repo (community-health files, workflow
templates, issue forms, Dependabot config) works at the _content_
level — it ships code and markdown that GitHub applies as defaults.

But a significant part of our security and review posture lives
in **GitHub's UI settings**, not in any file. That configuration
is easy to drift out of, and easy to forget when spinning up a
new repo.

This document is the **source of truth** for the settings we
intend to have in place. If the live GitHub configuration disagrees
with this document, either:

1. This document is wrong — update it. Or,
2. GitHub configuration is wrong — fix it.

Audit this document against reality at least once a quarter.
Changes require the same review bar as other security-adjacent
files (see [`CODEOWNERS`](./.github/CODEOWNERS)).

## Organization-level settings

### Member privileges

- **Base repository permission:** _Read_ for all org members.
  Write / Admin is granted via team membership, not via base
  permission.
- **Repository creation:** Restricted to org owners and the
  `@nyuchi/maintainers` team. Prevents ad-hoc repo sprawl.
- **Repository forking:** Allowed within the org; disallowed
  externally for private repos.
- **Pages creation:** Restricted to org owners.
- **Two-factor authentication:** **Required** for all members.

### Security features (org-wide)

Enable at **Settings → Code security and analysis** for the org,
and let the settings propagate to new repos as defaults:

| Feature                                 | State                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Dependency graph                        | **Enabled**                                   |
| Dependabot alerts                       | **Enabled**                                   |
| Dependabot security updates             | **Enabled**                                   |
| Dependabot version updates              | Opt-in per-repo via `.github/dependabot.yml`  |
| Secret scanning                         | **Enabled**                                   |
| Secret scanning — push protection       | **Enabled**                                   |
| Secret scanning — validity checks       | **Enabled**                                   |
| Secret scanning — non-provider patterns | **Enabled** (org-wide, not just public repos) |
| Private vulnerability reporting         | **Enabled**                                   |
| CodeQL default setup                    | Enabled per-repo (see below)                  |

### Actions permissions

At **Settings → Actions → General**:

- **Allowed actions:** _Allow select actions and reusable
  workflows_ — do not allow all actions unrestricted.
- **Allow actions created by GitHub:** **Yes.**
- **Allow actions by Marketplace verified creators:** **Yes.**
- **Allow specified actions and reusable workflows:** the
  allow-list below is the source of truth — every action used in
  [`.github/workflows/reusable-*.yml`](./.github/workflows/)
  must appear here. When adding a new action to any reusable
  workflow, update this list in the same PR.

  ```text
  actions/*,
  github/codeql-action/*,
  anchore/sbom-action@*,
  softprops/action-gh-release@*,
  DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2-action@*,
  amannn/action-semantic-pull-request@*,
  streetsidesoftware/cspell-action@*,
  lycheeverse/lychee-action@*,
  dorny/paths-filter@*,
  pnpm/action-setup@*,
  Swatinem/rust-cache@*,
  dtolnay/rust-toolchain@*,
  taiki-e/install-action@*,
  astral-sh/setup-uv@*,
  ossf/scorecard-action@*,
  foundry-rs/foundry-toolchain@*,
  docker/setup-qemu-action@*,
  docker/setup-buildx-action@*,
  docker/login-action@*,
  docker/build-push-action@*,
  docker/metadata-action@*,
  aquasecurity/trivy-action@*,
  sigstore/cosign-installer@*,
  opentofu/setup-opentofu@*,
  actions/attest-build-provenance@*,
  hashicorp/setup-terraform@*,
  terraform-linters/setup-tflint@*
  ```

  Note: `hashicorp/setup-terraform` and `terraform-linters/setup-tflint` are
  required only by the **deprecated** `reusable-ci-terraform.yml`. Repos that
  have migrated to `reusable-ci-opentofu.yml` do not need these two entries.
  They will be removed from this list once the legacy workflow is deleted.

  To audit drift against what's actually referenced in the
  reusables:

  ```sh
  grep -rhoE 'uses: [^@[:space:]]+' .github/workflows/ \
    | sort -u
  ```

- **Workflow permissions default:** _Read repository contents
  and packages permissions_. Individual workflows opt into more
  via their own `permissions:` block.
- **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests:**
  **Disabled.** Prevents a malicious action from self-approving.
- **Artifact and log retention:** 30 days.

### Domain verification

- **Verified domains:** `nyuchi.com`, `mukoko.com`, `siafudb.org`,
  `travel-info.co.zw`, `barstool.co.zw`.
  Email notifications for commits go only to addresses on verified
  domains, which makes commit impersonation harder.

---

## Repository-level defaults

These should hold for **every public repo** under
`nyuchi`, including any new repo created going forward.

### General

| Allow rebase merging                | Disabled (enable per-repo for release-train workflows only) |
| Default commit message for squash   | _Pull request title and description_                        |
| Always suggest updating PR branches | **Enabled**                                                 |

| Automatically delete head branches  | **Enabled**                                                 |

### Branch protection for `main`

At **Settings → Rules → Rulesets** (preferred) or **Settings →
Branches → Branch protection rules** (legacy):

| Rule                                                             | Value                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |

| Require signed commits                                           | **Enabled**                                      |
| Require a pull request before merging                            | **Enabled**                                      |
| Required approving reviews                                       | **0** (pre-scale solo-developer phase)           |
| Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed | **Enabled**                                      |
| Require review from Code Owners                                  | _Deferred_ until ≥ 2 engineers with merge rights |
| Require approval of the most recent reviewable push              | _Deferred_ until ≥ 2 engineers with merge rights |
| Require conversation resolution before merging                   | **Enabled**                                      |

> **Pre-scale reviewer posture.** The reviewer count is **0**
> during the solo-developer phase, per NA-01 Article 4.2 (flat
> structure, pre-scale reality). Every PR still goes through the

> conversation-resolution gates — just without an external
> reviewer because there isn't one yet. As soon as a second
> engineer with merge rights joins the org, the ruleset flips

> design. The trigger is documented in NA-01 Article 10.1 (the
> transition to formal divisional structure).

#### Required status checks

Every adopter calls the org's reusable workflows. Status check
names take the form `<caller-job-name> / <reusable-job-name>`. By
convention, every repo names its caller job after the workflow
purpose so the contexts read sensibly.

**Lint — required on every repo, no exceptions.** From a caller
named `lint:` calling `reusable-lint.yml`:

- `lint / actionlint`
- `lint / JSON validity`
- `lint / prettier`
- `lint / markdownlint`
- `lint / yamllint`

These five run on every PR to every repo and are blocking. CI
does not auto-fix; the developer fixes locally and pushes.

**Per-repo CI — required where applicable** (caller-job names
shown are conventions; the second segment is the reusable-job
name and is fixed):

- `pr-title / Conventional Commits` — from `reusable-pr-title-lint.yml`
- `dep-review / Review dependencies` — from `reusable-dependency-review.yml`
- `codeql / Analyze (*)` — from `reusable-codeql.yml`, per enabled language
- The primary CI job(s) — from whichever of
  `reusable-ci-nextjs-monorepo.yml`,
  `reusable-ci-rust-monorepo.yml`,
  `reusable-ci-python-monorepo.yml`, or
  `reusable-ci-docs-mdx.yml` the repo uses.

**Supply-chain and security gates added per-stack:**

- `ci / pnpm audit` — from `reusable-ci-nextjs-monorepo.yml` (moderate+ CVEs
  fail the PR; matches `dependency-review` but uses the pnpm lockfile directly)
- `ci / pip-audit` — from `reusable-ci-python-monorepo.yml` (scans the
  exported `uv` lockfile against PyPI advisory DB)
- `ci / cargo deny` — from `reusable-ci-rust-monorepo.yml` (advisories, bans,
  licence compliance, source verification; requires `deny.toml` in the repo root)

### Tag protection

- Tags matching `v*` require **admin** or
  `@nyuchi/maintainers` team approval to create, move, or
  delete. Prevents accidental release-tag rewrites.

---

## Secrets and tokens

### Org secrets (available to all repos by default)

| Name          | Used by                  | Source              |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| `TURBO_TOKEN` | `ci-nextjs-monorepo.yml` | Vercel Remote Cache |
| `TURBO_TEAM`  | `ci-nextjs-monorepo.yml` | Vercel Remote Cache |

**No long-lived cloud credentials** (AWS keys, GCP service-account
JSON, Cloudflare API tokens) should be stored as org or repo
secrets. Use OIDC federation with the cloud provider and scope
the trust policy to specific repos + branches + environments.

### Dependabot

Dependabot cannot read regular Actions secrets. If a Dependabot-
triggered workflow needs a secret, configure it at **Settings →
Secrets and variables → Dependabot**, and prefer narrowly-scoped
tokens.

---

## Enforcement and audit

- **Rulesets (in place):** branch and tag protection is enforced via
  GitHub Rulesets, not legacy per-repo branch-protection rules. The
  three ruleset definitions live in [`github-rulesets/`](./github-rulesets/)
  in this repo:

  - `main-branch-protection.json` — applied to `nyuchi/.github`
    (2-approver, 5 lint checks).
  - `release-tag-protection.json` — applied to `nyuchi/.github`
    (protects `v*.*.*` tags).
  - `org-wide-main-protection.json` — applied at the org level to
    all repos except `sandbox-*` and `archive-*` (1-approver, 5 lint
    checks).

  Apply or update via:

  ```sh
  gh api --method POST /repos/nyuchi/.github/rulesets \
    --input github-rulesets/main-branch-protection.json
  gh api --method POST /orgs/nyuchi/rulesets \
    --input github-rulesets/org-wide-main-protection.json
  ```

- **In progress — infrastructure as code:** migrating org and repo
  configuration to OpenTofu (the open-source Terraform fork) using
  the `integrations/github` provider. When complete this document
  becomes a generated artifact rather than hand-maintained prose.
  Target: all new repos provisioned via `tofu apply` by Q3 2026.
  The `reusable-ci-opentofu.yml` reusable workflow supports this.
- **Quarterly audit (automated):** a GitHub Actions scheduled workflow
  (`.github/workflows/scheduled-settings-audit.yml`) opens a GitHub
  Issue on the first day of every quarter with a checklist of items to
  verify. Close the issue once the audit is complete and any drift has
  been corrected.

---

## Artifact provenance and supply-chain security

### SLSA provenance (SLSA L2)

Every release attaches a **GitHub Artifact Attestation** (SLSA L2
provenance) signed with a short-lived OIDC token via Sigstore. This is
generated automatically by the `attestations` step in
`reusable-release.yml` and by the standalone
`reusable-slsa-provenance.yml` workflow.

Attestations can be verified by any user with read access to the
repository:

```sh
gh attestation verify <artifact-file> --repo nyuchi/<repo>
```

Each release also ships a `SHA256SUMS` file covering all attached
release assets. Consumers must verify this file against the attestation
before executing any release artifact.

### OpenSSF alignment

The organisation targets the following OpenSSF / SLSA milestones:

| Practice                              | Target                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| SHA-pinned Actions (supply-chain)     | **Enforced** — NA-03 §7.1.1                              |
| SBOM on every production release      | **Enforced** — NA-03 §7.2, `reusable-sbom.yml`           |
| Artifact provenance (SLSA L2)         | **Enforced** — `reusable-release.yml` + attestation step |
| OIDC federation for cloud credentials | **Required** — see §Secrets and tokens below             |
| Dependency review on every PR         | **Enforced** — `reusable-dependency-review.yml`          |
| Secret scanning (all patterns)        | **Enabled** — org-wide                                   |
| Signed commits on `main`              | **Enforced** — rulesets                                  |
| OpenSSF Scorecard                     | **Available** — `reusable-openssf-scorecard.yml`         |
| SLSA L3 (hermetic builds)             | Planned — requires isolated build runners                |

### Reusable workflow versioning and rollback

Consuming repos reference reusables at `@main`, so changes propagate
instantly on the next CI run. To avoid a broken change from silently
affecting every downstream repo:

1. **Test in isolation first.** Always run the reusable's own
   `lint.yml` CI before merging to `main`.
2. **Use feature flags via workflow inputs.** New behaviour is opt-in
   (`default: false`) for at least one release cycle before becoming
   the default.
3. **Rollback procedure.** If a merged change breaks downstream repos:
   - Open a hotfix branch in `nyuchi/.github`.
   - Revert the offending commit.
   - Merge immediately (no waiting for the normal review bar if the
     regression is confirmed and the Founder approves — per NA-01
     Article 6.1(a)).
   - Notify affected repo maintainers via a GitHub Issue.
4. **Versioned refs (planned).** Long-term, critical consumers should
   reference a `@v1`, `@v2` tag rather than `@main` to opt into
   upgrades deliberately. This is tracked as a future enhancement.

---

## OIDC federation for cloud credentials

Long-lived cloud API keys (AWS, GCP, Cloudflare, Fly.io) must **not**
be stored as GitHub secrets. Use OIDC federation so workflows obtain
short-lived tokens at runtime. The trust policy must be scoped to
specific repositories, branches, and environments.

### Cloudflare example

```yaml
- name: Authenticate to Cloudflare via OIDC
  uses: cloudflare/cloudflare-action@v1   # pin to SHA per NA-03 §7.1.1
  with:
    api-token: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}  # narrow-scope token
```

For a Cloudflare Workers deployment the preferred approach is Wrangler
with a scoped API token generated from a service account, not a Global
API key.

### Fly.io example

```yaml
- name: Deploy to Fly.io
  env:
    FLY_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FLY_API_TOKEN }}   # deploy-only token
  run: flyctl deploy --remote-only
```

Generate the `FLY_API_TOKEN` via `fly tokens create deploy` — this
creates a token scoped to deploy operations only, not account admin.
Store it as a repository- or environment-level secret, never as an
org-level secret unless the token legitimately covers all repos.

### AWS / GCP (future)

When Nyuchi services expand to AWS or GCP, use OIDC federation:

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

steps:
  - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4   # pin to SHA
    with:
      role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/GitHubActionsRole
      aws-region: af-south-1
      role-session-name: GitHubActions
```

Document the trust policy (`aud`, `sub` conditions) in the Terraform
module for that environment.

---

## Supply chain security

### Container signing and verification

All OCI images built and published by Nyuchi repos must be:

1. **Scanned** by Trivy (CRITICAL + HIGH severity — exit-code 1) before push.
2. **Signed** with cosign keyless signing using the `reusable-ci-container.yml`
   reusable workflow.
3. **Verified** by consumers: `cosign verify --certificate-oidc-issuer
https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com --certificate-identity-regexp
'https://github.com/nyuchi/'`.

The OIDC issuer and identity regexp above act as the trust anchor —
only images built by a GitHub Actions workflow in the `nyuchi` org
will verify successfully. Do not use a long-lived cosign key.

### SLSA provenance

All published releases must include SLSA level 2 provenance
attestations (enforced today — see "SLSA provenance (SLSA L2)"
above):

- The `reusable-release.yml` reusable workflow already attaches a
  CycloneDX SBOM (NA-03 §7.2).
- Container images built by `reusable-ci-container.yml` include
  BuildKit-generated SBOM and provenance via `sbom: true` and
  `provenance: true` in the build step.
- For binary releases (Rust crates, Python wheels, JS packages),
  add SLSA provenance via `slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator`
  when the toolchain supports it.

### Trivy IaC scanning

All OpenTofu / Terraform configurations must be scanned with Trivy
in `config` mode (CRITICAL + HIGH). The `reusable-ci-opentofu.yml`
reusable workflow does this automatically. SARIF results appear in
each repo's GitHub Security tab.

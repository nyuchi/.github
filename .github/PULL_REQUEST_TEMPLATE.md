### Process

- [ ] My PR **title** follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- [ ] All of my commits are **signed** and show "Verified" on GitHub
      (GPG or SSH). See
      [CONTRIBUTING.md § Signed commits](https://github.com/nyuchi/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#signed-commits-required).
- [ ] All of my commits have a **DCO sign-off** (`Signed-off-by:` trailer,
      added by `git commit -s`).
- [ ] My branch name follows `<type>/<short-kebab-description>` (see
      [CONTRIBUTING.md § Branch naming](https://github.com/nyuchi/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#branch-naming)).
- [ ] I have **rebased** onto the latest default branch; no merge commits
      from the base branch in this PR.
- [ ] I have added or updated **tests** covering the change (or explained
      below why tests aren't applicable).
- [ ] I have updated **documentation** (README, inline docs, changelog,
      migration notes) where relevant.
- [ ] I ran the repo's local checks (lint, typecheck, tests) and they pass.
- [ ] Any new **runtime dependencies** are justified in this PR description
      (name, version, license, why).
- [ ] If this is a breaking change, I have marked the box above and
      included a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer in at least one commit.

### NA-03 merge blockers

<!-- These checks mirror the Quick Reference in NA-03 §§ 3–7.
     Tick only the boxes that are relevant to this PR. If none apply,
     check "N/A" and leave the others blank. -->

- [ ] **N/A** — this change does not touch schema, APIs, dependencies,
      cryptography, data placement, or smart-contract counts.
      _(If ticked, skip the remaining boxes in this section.)_
- [ ] **Secret hygiene** — I confirmed no API keys, tokens, `.env` contents,
      private keys, or credentials appear anywhere in the diff.
- [ ] **Prohibited dependencies** — this PR introduces no Flutter,
      Couchbase, or CouchDB-as-datastore dependency, and contains no
      reference to a fixed 10-billion MXT supply cap.
- [ ] **Schema.org compliance** — new database tables, columns, or API fields
      map to Schema.org types, or the PR description justifies any deviation.
- [ ] **Locked counts respected** — no change to the platform's locked counts
      (17 mini-apps · 7 data layers · 7 covenants · 40 interest categories ·
      12 manifesto sections · 3 sources of truth)
      without Founder approval documented in the PR description.
- [ ] **Frontier defaults** — for user-facing or infrastructure work:
      offline / local-first behaviour has been considered; any new
      cryptographic primitive has a documented post-quantum migration path;
      edge-native placement has been addressed.
- [ ] **New GitHub Actions** are pinned to a 40-character commit SHA
      (not a floating tag) per NA-03 §7.1.1.

## Additional notes
